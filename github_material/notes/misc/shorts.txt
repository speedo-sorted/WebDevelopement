why asynchronous js ?

say u want to show photo from server
then you first need to download it.
if you don't wait for it to download and try to display it, it would be blank.
so no. 1 - we need to wait for it to download before we can show it.
pt-2 if we wait for it to download and then show then next processes will get blocked - importantly UI. 
so - async procedure means if some timeconsuming process ( usually non-js ) you can proceed with next 
processes and once it is complete do the process with the fetched resource.
